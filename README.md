# Welcome to the Lettering Project Tracker ðŸ‘‹

>Our goal is to make it easy for hand lettering artists to track their work. Users can add projects with a title, quote, style, and optional photo. To each project a user can add the tools used to create their masterpiece. 

>Users can also peruse the database for inspiration by looking at other artists' projects.
