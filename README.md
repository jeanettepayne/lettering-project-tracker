DESCRIPTION 

Welcome to the Lettering Project Tracker! Our goal is to make it easy for hand lettering artists to track their work. Users can add projects with a title, quote, style, and optional photo. To each project a user can add the tools used to create their masterpiece. 

Users can also peruse the database for inspiration by looking at other artists' projects.

INSTALLATION

To use the Lettering Project Tracker, fork and clone this repo to your local environment, bundle install, and open a rails server ("rails s")
